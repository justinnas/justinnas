🌌 Hello, I'm Justinas. Program Systems student at Kaunas University of Technology. 
I'm passionate about software development, web development, graphic design, and more.

🌠 I enjoy exploring new technologies and trying out different programming languages, so expect here to find a mix of personal projects, university assignments, and other experiments.
